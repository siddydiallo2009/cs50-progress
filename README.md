# cs50-progress
Documenting my journey through CS50 while building the foundations of both AI engineering and entrepreneurship.
This repository tracks my learning, my ideas, the concepts I master, and the projects I build step by step with the long-term goal of becoming a world class AI innovator and tech business creator.
I’m using CS50 not just to learn programming, but to build the mindset, discipline, and portfolio that will fuel future AI companies, products, and breakthroughs.
More updates will be added as I progress through problem sets, major concepts, and project milestones.
